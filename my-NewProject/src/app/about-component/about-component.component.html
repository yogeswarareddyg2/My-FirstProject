  American musical duo She & Him has recorded more than 90 songs. 
  Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward formed the band after working on their
   rendition of "When I Get to the Border" from the soundtrack of The 
   Go-Getter (2007). Their debut album, Volume One was released under indie
    label Merge Records in 2008. In 2010, Deschanel penned eleven tracks for 
    their follow-up release Volume Two (2010), where her lyrics touch on 
    themes of romance and self-appreciation. The duo's first Christmas
     album A Very She & Him Christmas (2011) was recorded over the course
      of six days. Their fourth studio album, Volume 3 (2013) features more 
      disco elements and string arrangements than their previous work. After
       signing with Columbia Records, She & Him started working on their 
       major-label debut Classics (2014) with thirteen covers, recorded 
       live and accompanied by a 20-piece orchestra. Their second Christmas
        release, Christmas Party was released in 2016
